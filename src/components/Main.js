            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                I love to develop and learn new features and things.
                That is one of the main reasons I like being a developer.
                It's one of the few careers where you can be creative and either
                build on existing platforms or create from scratch a new ide and
                offer it to the world to enjoy and give feedback on.
            </p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
            I love to go hiking and I want to get a new gym memebership so I can
            start going back to the gym. I really like cooking new things i find 
            off the internet. I enjoy looking at the crypto markets and being able to 
            get a great position on one of my favorite investments.
